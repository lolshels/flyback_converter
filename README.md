# Flyback Switching Power Supply

Design and simulation work for an isolated flyback switching power supply.

The project is being developed in two stages: a **low-voltage development prototype** for safe simulation and learning, followed by adaptation to the final universal AC input specification.

## Development Prototype Specifications

| Parameter           | Value   |
| ------------------- | ------- |
| Input               | 24 VDC  |
| Output              | 12 V    |
| Output power        | 24 W    |
| Output current      | 2 A     |
| Switching frequency | 100 kHz |
| Efficiency target   | 85%     |
| Regulation          | ±5%     |
| Isolation           | Yes     |

The low-voltage input is being used during the initial flyback design and simulation to avoid working with the high-voltage DC bus produced by an AC mains rectifier.

The output remains fixed at **12 V / 2 A** for this version. An adjustable-output version is planned as a future iteration.

## Final Target Specifications

| Parameter           | Value      |
| ------------------- | ---------- |
| Input               | 90–264 VAC |
| Input frequency     | 60 Hz      |
| Output              | 12 V       |
| Output power        | 24 W       |
| Output current      | 2 A        |
| Switching frequency | 100 kHz    |
| Efficiency target   | 85%        |
| Regulation          | ±5%        |
| Isolation           | Yes        |

The final version will use a universal AC input with a bridge rectifier, bulk capacitor, inrush-current limiting, and isolated flyback converter.
